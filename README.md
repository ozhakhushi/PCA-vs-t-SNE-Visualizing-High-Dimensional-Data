# From High Dimensions to Insight: PCA & t-SNE on Real-World Data

This project demonstrates **dimensionality reduction** techniques, specifically **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**, applied to real-world datasets. The goal is to reduce high-dimensional data into lower dimensions for **visualization and pattern discovery**, while retaining meaningful structure.

## Project Overview

High-dimensional datasets are common in real-world applications but can be difficult to interpret. This project explores how PCA and t-SNE can transform such datasets into 2D or 3D representations that reveal hidden patterns, clusters, and relationships between features.

### Key Objectives
- Preprocess and standardize datasets for fair feature contribution.
- Apply PCA for linear dimensionality reduction.
- Apply t-SNE for non-linear, structure-preserving embedding.
- Visualize results in 2D and 3D to extract insights.
- Compare PCA and t-SNE effectiveness on real-world data.

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets (e.g., Wine dataset, Iris dataset) to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and visualization. Features are standardized before applying PCA and t-SNE.
